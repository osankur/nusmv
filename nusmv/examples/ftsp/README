FTSP Model for the FM'16 submission 
Ocan Sankur <ocan.sankur@irisa.fr>

Type make to generate the models in the generated directory.
Use the check.sh script in the nusmv directory to verify the models.
For example:

./check.sh examples/ftsp/generated/ftsp-incr-3.smv 0

The last argument refers to the spec number to be verified.

Warning: Note that the script checks if the given INVARSPEC is satisfied *eventually*.
In other terms, it checks F(G(inv)) where inv is the invariant.
Moreover, it reads the value of the counter compte and outputs its maximal
value after which G(inv) holds.
This check is a semi-algorithm and can be replaced with the standard invariant check for the property:

INVARSPEC (compte >= 20 -> inv)

where 20 is a guess, and inv is the invariant from the current files.
This is slower in general.
